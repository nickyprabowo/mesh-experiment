# Mocking API with GraphQL Mesh

GraphQL Mesh is actually a GraphQL Gateway which can turn any sources into GraphQL.
[GraphQL Mesh Docs](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh)
In this project, I try to emulate what I used to do at work when developing feature using GraphQL API.
As soon as the team agree on API contract, frontend and backend developer can start their work. As a frontend I start with creating a mock API, though not so often, based on contract then start coding for the app. Here's how I do it

## Start the Project

1. yarn install
2. yarn dev
