# Mocking API with GraphQL Mesh

GraphQL Mesh is actually a GraphQL Gateway which can turn any sources into GraphQL.
In this project, I try to emulate what I used to do at work when developing feature using GraphQL API.
As soon as the team agree upon an API contract, frontend and backend developer can start their work. As a frontend, I start with creating a mock API based on contract then start coding for the app, though not so often depending on the availability of endpoint. And here's how I do it

## Start the Project

1. yarn install
2. yarn dev
